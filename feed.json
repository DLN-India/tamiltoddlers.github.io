Keep all the things ready with you before day so that you will be able to finish the activity. Take things slowly and start teaching one letter a week. Do not put that Tamil is a difficult language to learn. Never say that in front of the child. If we practise it is going to be very easy for them. So encourage them even if they make mistakes.

Show the letter to your kiddo and ask him. Then give him the crayons and ask him to color the tail. Later the final part of sticking the eyes. Stick it and your அணில் is ready. :)<br><br>PS: If you don't have paint at home right now, use mike of turmeric powder and kumkum. I did the same and the result was amazing.
