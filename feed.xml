                <p>I've shared all the activities that I did with my son to learn Tamil Uyir ezhuthukkal. Keep all the things ready with you before day so that you will be able to finish the activity. Take things slowly and start teaching one letter a week. Do not assume that Tamil is a difficult language to learn. Never say that in front of the child. If we practise it is going to be very easy. So encourage them even if they make mistakes. Reminding you once again, Take it slowly one letter a week !  </p>
<p>All the activities to be done under parent guidance only.</p>
<p>You can download Uyir ezhuthukkal worksheets from</p>
<a href="https://tamiltoddlers.github.io/uyir-ezhuthukkal-free-printables.html" title="Free printables. ">Free printables.  </a>
<p>All the activities are for reference. Be creative in your own way. And share your work with us through e-mail : tamiltoddlers@gmail.com</p>
<p>Best wishes :) </p>

<p>Required materials: </p>
<p>A4 paper , Paint, Paintbrush,Crayons,Glue, Googly eyes, Marker/ Sketch, Cloth to wipe.</p>
<p>Procedure:<br>First write the letters <span style="font-weight: 400;">அ and the word </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">அணில் with marker. Read the letter two to three times and ask them once (reinforcement). Now paint the foot with brown colour (my son was all giggly as it was chill :D) , ask you little one to place the foot on the paper. Immediately take the cloth and wipe their legs (or you will have to wipe the entire home ;-) ). Let it dry. Now outline the feet with marker and draw a bigggg tail. Show the letter to your kiddo and ask him. Then give him the crayons and ask him to color the tail. Later the final part of sticking the eyes. Stick it and your அணில் is ready. :)<br><br>PS: If you don't have paint at home right now, use mike of turmeric powder and kumkum. I did the same and the result was amazing. Look at the picture yourself and tell me :D</span></p>
