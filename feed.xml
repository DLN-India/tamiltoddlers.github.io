                <p>I've shared all the activities that I did with my son to learn Tamil Uyir ezhuthukkal. Keep all the things ready with you before day so that you will be able to finish the activity. Take things slowly and start teaching one letter a week. Do not put that Tamil is a difficult language to learn. Never say that in front of the child. If we practise it is going to be very easy for them. So encourage them even if they make mistakes. Again reminding you , Take it slowly one letter a week ! </p>
<p>Best wishes :) <br><br></p>

Immediately take the cloth and wipe their legs (or you will have to wipe the entire home ;-) ). Let it dry. Now outline the feet with marker and draw a bigggg tail. Show the letter to your kiddo and ask him. Then give him the crayons and ask him to color the tail. Later the final part of sticking the eyes. Stick it and your அணில் is ready. :)<br><br>PS: If you don't have paint at home right now, use mike of turmeric powder and kumkum. I did the same and the result was amazing.
